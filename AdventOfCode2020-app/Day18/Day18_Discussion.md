# Day 18 - Operation Order

<https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/18>

I spun my wheels on Part 2 for quite a while and went down several dead ends before figuring out a relatively simple approach.  I feel somewhat motivated to study up on expression parsing.  Will see if the feeling fades.

After committing my initial solution I reworked the parsing logic and changed some names.  The new code is clearer and more "parser-like" -- I even put the grammar in one of the function comments.  I also added a small tweak to enable Part 1 and Part 2 to use the same code, with only a boolean flag indicating the difference.
