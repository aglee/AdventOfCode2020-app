# Day 21 - Allergen Assessment

<https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/21>

I didn't get started on Day 21 until about 12:30AM, when I finally solved Part 2 from Day 20.

When I started reading the puzzle description I had the idea it might help to think of it as a code breaking puzzle -- you can imagine that ingredient names are actually code words for allergen names.  It was only a passing thought, but it did help me understand the problem being described.

I was better tonight about sloppily copy-pasting from Part 1 to solve Part 2 instead of getting sidetracked trying to factor out commonality.  Afterwards I moved my solution to a `Menu` class that solves both problems.  For some reason this refactoring took longer than coding the solution in the first place.  I think it would have helped if I'd gone to bed and saved the refactoring for later.  Learning when to call it a night is still a thing I'm working on.

For Day 21 I used similar process-of-elimination logic to one of the early puzzles.
