# Day 25 - Combo Breaker

<https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/25>

Most of the time I spent was understanding the problem.  My solution algorithm was trial and error: trying loop sizes of 1, 2, 3, etc.

This time I was *too* hasty in submitting an answer.  When my initial tests gave right answers, I spaced out and submitted a loop size, which was only an intermediate result.  I still needed to compute the encryption key.  But it didn't take long.  A nice, easy Day 25 as usual, ending on a low-stress note.

I notice the name of this puzzle was not an alliteration like the 24 previous ones.  I'm sure there will be some grumbling about that. :)
