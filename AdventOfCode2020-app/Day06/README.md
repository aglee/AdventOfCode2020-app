# Day 6 - Custom Customs

The key in both parts was using set operations: union in Part 1 and intersection in Part 2.

I needlessly hurried and misread Part 1, so my initial answer was wrong.  Lesson learned (again).  I would have caught the bug with stricter testing: not only checking that `11` was my answer but that `3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1` was my answer.
